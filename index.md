I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu/), working at the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)](https://allenai.org/aristo). I am advised by Prof. [Matthew Gombolay](https://sites.gatech.edu/matthew-gombolay/).

I work on the **Language Models (LMs) for code generation and 3D design** with the goal of increasing their performance and safety.

**I am looking for a research internship for the summer 2025, please reach out if you think I would be a good fit.**


 
### Selected papers
- **[Generating CAD Code with Vision-Language Models for 3D Designs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05340)**: *Under review*
- **[Can LLMs Patch Security Issues?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00024)**: *Under review*
