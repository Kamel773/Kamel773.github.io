I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu/), working at the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics). I am advised by Prof. [Matthew Gombolay](https://sites.gatech.edu/matthew-gombolay/).

I focus on natural language processing and machine learning, with an emphasis on improving Large Language Models (LLMs) for generation and refinement. My long-term goal is to create intelligent systems that help engineers, developers, and designers work more efficiently.
